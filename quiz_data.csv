1,Why is my CalFresh application taking so long how long it takes to get approved?,"I'm so sorry to hear that . It normally takes the county 30 days to fully process a case and make a decision.

2,I feel like my CalFresh benefits amount was reduced by mistake. How do I appeal?,"You can appeal your CalFresh benefit reduction by submitting a formal appeal through your state’s CalFresh agency website or by calling their customer service. Gather evidence like recent income statements, bills, or documentation that supports your claim. Complete the appeal form thoroughly and submit it within 30 days of receiving the notice. Include any correspondence or letters you’ve sent regarding the reduction. You may also request a hearing if the agency denies your appeal. Consider contacting your local agency or a nonprofit food assistance advocate for guidance. Be prepared to attend a hearing if requested. Keep copies of all submitted documents. Follow up in writing to confirm receipt of your appeal.",qwen3-vl-8b,"I am sorry to hear that your benefits have recently decreased. Changes to CalFresh benefits are generally caused by a change in income and/or expenses that was recently reported to the county, amongst other factors. You do have the right to ask for a hearing though if you think there is something wrong with your CalFresh case, or if you think you were incorrectly denied for CalFresh.

The county office will send you a written Notice of Action before it stops, reduces or changes your benefits. If you request a hearing before the change takes place, your benefits will continue as normal until the hearing or your certification period ends.

How to ask for a hearing:

- Call toll free: 1-800-952-5253 OR
- Complete an online form: https://acms.dss.ca.gov/acms/page.request.do?page=public.intakeForm OR 
- Fill out the back of any Notice of Action

3,I have been convicted for selling drugs. Can I get food stamps? I live in Florida,"As a convicted drug offender, you may be eligible for food stamp benefits in Florida, but there are certain restrictions and requirements that apply to your situation.

Under Florida law, individuals who have been convicted of certain drug-related offenses may be disqualified from receiving food stamps for a period of time. Specifically, if you have been convicted of selling or distributing drugs, you will be disqualified from receiving food stamps for at least one year after the date of your conviction.

However, if you are otherwise eligible for food stamps and meet the program's income and resource requirements, you may still be able to receive benefits. To qualify, you must meet the following criteria:

* Your income must be within the program's income limits.
* You must have limited resources (such as cash and savings) that are available to purchase food.
* You must be a U.S. citizen or eligible immigrant.
* You must reside in Florida.

It is important to note that the food stamp program has specific rules and requirements, and these can vary by state. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a local social service agency or a legal aid organization for more information on how these rules apply to your situation.",meta-llama-2-7b-chat,"No. In Florida, most people convicted for selling drugs can't get food stamps.

You are not eligible if:

* the conviction was for things you did after August 22, 1996 
* a court has not expunged your conviction

If the conviction was for things you did before August 22, 1996 then you are eligible. You are eligible even if the date of your conviction was after August 22, 1996

Even if you aren't eligible, other people in your household can still be eligible. That means you can still apply for food stamps for other people who live with you.

You can be eligible for food stamps in the future if a court expunges your conviction. You would need to prove that a court had expunged your conviction. You could provide a court order to the Florida Department of Children and families as proof.",Policy (humans)
4,"If I apply for SNAP, can ICE get my information? I live in Vermont","SNAP and ICE Information Sharing

Short answer: Generally no, but with caveats.

- SNAP applications are handled by state/local agencies, not shared with ICE by default
- Vermont has additional protections limiting data sharing with immigration enforcement
- However, if you're asked about immigration status during the application, false statements could create separate legal issues
- If ICE obtains information through other means (warrant, criminal investigation), SNAP records could be accessed

For your specific situation, consult a local immigration attorney or Vermont Legal Aid for personalized advice.",claude-haiku-4-5-20251001,"Vermont has already given some private information about people who get food help (3SquaresVT) to the federal government. This happened because the federal government (USDA) asked all states for a list of names, birthdays, home addresses, and Social Security numbers.

Vermont leaders said they had to share this data to follow federal law and to make sure the state didn't lose its funding for food help. They did not share information about whether people are U.S. citizens or not.

The federal government says they want this data to find fraud. However, some people are worried that ICE could use this information in the future for immigration rules.

If you are applying for 3SquaresVT now, your information will likely be shared with the federal government as part of these rules. Before you apply, you should think about the help your family needs and any risks that feel important to you.""",Policy (humans)
5,I live in Indiana. Can I buy a Kit-Kat with SNAP?,"No. If you live in Indiana and try to purchase a Kit-Kat with your SNAP benefits today, you wouldn't be able to use your EBT card. Indiana recently passed laws that restrict the purchase of soft drinks and candy with your EBT card.",Policy (humans),"Yes. SNAP benefits can be used to buy candy, including Kit-Kat bars, in Indiana as long as you’re shopping at a SNAP-authorized retailer. SNAP covers most foods for home consumption; it does not cover alcohol, tobacco, vitamins/medicine, non-food items, or hot/prepared foods.",gpt-5.2
